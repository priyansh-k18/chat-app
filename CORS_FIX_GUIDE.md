# 🚨 CORS Issue - Quick Fix Guide

## ❌ Current Problem
Your frontend at `https://chat-app-cyan-sigma.vercel.app` is getting CORS errors when trying to connect to your backend at `https://chat-app-backend-f8h6yuew0-priyansh-k18s-projects.vercel.app`

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. Updated Frontend Config
- Changed backend URL from old URL to: `https://chat-app-backend-f8h6yuew0-priyansh-k18s-projects.vercel.app`

### 2. Enhanced Backend CORS Configuration
- Added your frontend domain to allowed origins
- Added proper HTTP methods and headers
- Improved CORS options

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Set Environment Variable in Vercel Backend
Go to your backend project in Vercel dashboard and add:
```
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://chat-app-cyan-sigma.vercel.app
```

### 2. Redeploy Backend
```bash
cd server
vercel --prod
```

### 3. Test the Fix
After redeployment, try signing up again. The CORS error should be gone.

## 🔍 What Was Wrong
- Backend CORS configuration wasn't allowing requests from your frontend domain
- Missing proper CORS headers and methods
- Frontend was pointing to wrong backend URL

## 📱 Test These URLs
- Frontend: `https://chat-app-cyan-sigma.vercel.app`
- Backend: `https://chat-app-backend-f8h6yuew0-priyansh-k18s-projects.vercel.app/`

## 🚨 If Still Having Issues
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify environment variable is set
3. Clear browser cache
4. Test backend endpoints directly
